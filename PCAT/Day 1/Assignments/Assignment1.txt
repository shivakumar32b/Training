Assignment 1: Write a detailed pseudocode for a simple program that takes a number as input, calculates the square if it's even or the cube if it's odd, and then outputs the result. Incorporate conditional and looping constructs.

 Start

 Display "Enter a number:"
 Read num
 declare square and cube 
 if (num%2==0) then
    square = num * num
    Display "The square of " + num + " is " + square
 else
    cube = num * num * num
    Display "The cube of " + num + " is " + cube
 end if

 End
